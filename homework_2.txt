Assignment 2 
Code used to add & commit mckeegan_assignment1 to GitHub

#First I made a new directory because this is going to be my repository
#It's called getgitty
$ mkdir getgitty
$ cd getgitty
#Then I initialized an empty repository in the getgitty directory
$ git init
###QUESTION: is there a way to make the directory and name the repo in one command?
#Like for instance, would typing git init getgitty just go ahead and make that?
#Anyway these were after thoughts...

####### not that I am aware of but worth a google?


#Then I moved my assignment from the directory it was in to where I was working
#I realize I could've done this before init
$ mv ../mckeegan_assignment1.txt .
#And finally made .txt file for this documentation
$ touch homework_2.txt
$ open homework_2.txt

#Anywhooo sorry now for the good stuff!
#### cant wait!
#Linking directory to GitHub
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/mckeegank/getgitty.git
#I did this after clicking around on my GitHub to make that repository...
#Could I have done that from the command line? I guess that's related to the question above
#Checking if it worked... it did!
$ git remote -v

#And now adding it... and it breaks
#Tried git status, all looks good
#Did a git add for both documents (this one and assignment 1), then git commit
#git status and git log look good
#But when I try git origin push master this is what I see:
# ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
#error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/mckeegank/getgitty.git'
#hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
#hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
#hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
#hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

#This doesn't make sense to me, and when I try to pull there is nothing to pull yet (obviously)
#I tried all our git branch and git checkout master tricks to make sure I was in the right branch
#But hey, the internet is a wonderful thing. This might be dangerous, but it worked:
$ git push -f origin master
#As I understand it, -f forced it up there?
#Since I've been adding all this now, I might have a conflict but hey we know how to resolve!

## nice job. the branch issue is annoying. well done figuring out a solve here.
